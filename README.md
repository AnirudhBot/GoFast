# GoFast
## Web application exhibiting dijakstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between 15+ cities connected through road and air
<br />
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph.  It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

As you land on the website, it generates an undirected graph with weighted edges consisting of 15 Indian cities/states as nodes. The edge weight represents the distance between the adjacent cities. GoFast allows you to select a source and a destination city between which you wish to calculate the shortest path. As you click on "Solve", another graph depicting the shortest route between the source and the destination is generated.
